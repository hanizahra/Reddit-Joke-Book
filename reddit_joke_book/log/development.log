I hadn't made friends yet so I had to go to the play alone. When I got there I found out the theater was so small that they assigned seats. So not only was I going to be by myself watching a play, I couldn't even hide in that sweet, sweet corner seat like SAP.\n\n My ticket placed my right next to the most beautiful girl I'd ever met. She had red hair, freckles, and a little gap between her teeth. She turned to me before the play started and said \"If this gets really bad, please promise to shoot me\". I laughed and we started talking. We spent the whole play sans the intermission talking and making fun of the bad acting. As the play came to a close I decided I was going to ask her out. \n\nAs the play ends and we file out of the theater, I start talking to her. I say how I had a really great time and somehow managed to stammer out \"I had a really fun time talking with you, would you maybe wanna catch dinner or something sometime?\". She gasped, and said \"Oh my God, I'm so sorry but I'm here with my boyfriend\". Then she nudged the kid who had sat on the other side of her during the play. He turned, looked at me, then silently waved and turned away.\n\nEmbarrassment does not even begin to describe what I was feeling. The problem with embarrassment is that the men in my family react strangely to it. Some people start to nervous laugh, some people apologize, I mean hey it happens. My family however has taught me that the best way to alleviate embarrassment is to start telling jokes nonstop until the situation is no longer awkward.\n\n So there I am, staring at this stunning girl in front of her boyfriend, and I suddenly become the conductor of the Bad Joke Express, and someone's cut the motherfucking brakes. I'm barreling through one bad joke after another. Anything from knock-knock jokes, to why'd the chicken cross the road conundrums. Just hoping to god she laughs so I can save face. Eventually my brain decides it's a good time to ask \"For a girl with a boyfriend, you sure seemed focused on me during the play. Why weren't you talking to him?\"\n\nHer boyfriend is a deaf-mute. She couldn't talk to him during the play because A.) She can't exactly covertly sign in a theater, and B.) He was reading the actors lips to find out what was going on.\n\nAt this point I did 2 things. I started nervous laughing in an extremely high pitched falsetto voice, and I started running back to my dorm. I didn't even say goodbye. I just ran.\n\nThis is my biggest social regret in life."], ["author", "staticzapper"]]

Lots of stuff happening while my husband and I lived there, together it seemed like a haunting but when you took each occurrence separately there could be plausible explanations for all of them: shoddy electrical work, faulty appliances, house settling, coincidence etc. \n\nSomething happened one day we can't even logically explain and my husband doesn't like to talk about it because he doesn't believe in any of that stuff. \n\nSo one of the things we got semi-regularly was a knock at the door or window. It would happen once, we would answer the door, no one there. Bored kids seemed the logical explanation. One afternoon we got the knock, no one there. A few minutes later it happened again. No one there. We did a walk around the front of the house to scare off the little turds, saw nothing, went inside. Less than a minute later another knock, louder this time. My husband ran to the door and opened it quickly to try to catch them. Nothing. \n\nSo we decided to catch them out this time. My husband ducked down behind the door and I hid at the curtains that faced the front door area. The knocks came again, My husband threw open the door and I opened the curtain: there was no one out the front, there couldn't be. Less than a second later the loudest knocking I had ever heard came from our back glass door. I turned my head as I had a perfect view of the back door and yard and nothing. Nothing at all. Then, while I was still looking it happened again: knock, knock, knock. The glass vibrated from it, yet no one was there. \n\nWe looked for rocks or anything else that could have been thrown, even though we knew it sounded nothing like rocks. It never happened again and we moved out soon after (for different reasons). "], ["author", "pretend_it_is_a_plan"]]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

The sight was all too real; /u/RamsesThePigeon, head propped against the headboard, surveying his tight body, wearing a yellow duck costume which hugged his fantastic frame quite nicely. \n\n\"Get over here. I want the D.\" His voice had dropped to almost a whisper, dulcet tones which pulled /u/fuckswithducks towards the bed, magnetised by pure lust. They embraced, and Ramses felt Ducky's warm breath on his neck. Two lovers entwined, bodies in sync, understanding and reciprocating each other's moves, each other's desires. They kissed for what felt like days, but must only have been minutes. \n\nBut nothing was enough to satiate Ducky's hunger for what lay beneath the costume. \n\n\"Turn over.\" Taking control now, he commanded his lover to roll. Without another word he unzipped the back of the pants, yellow feathers gave way and parted to show milky white flesh, untanned. Both of them knew what came next. His hands went down to his own final layer, and he felt the secret beneath, throbbing excitedly at the prospect, the meal that lay before him. He had often fantasised about this very moment - but to have it actually happening? Right before his eyes? It was almost too much. He couldn't bear to savour it any longer, and with a lusty grunt, he unleashed the beast and ran his fingers over the curved backside, ready to---\n\n*knock knock knock*\n\n\"Oh shit!\" Duck shouted with a whisper, and dashed over to the window, leaving Ramses alone on the mattress. The candlelight gave way to harsh sunlight as he pulled the curtains back and glanced down to the front door. \n\n*Oh, fuck*. \n\nIt was Sproggy and Vargas, come to pay a birthday visit. That had been why Ramses was there in the first place, for a little birthday surprise. It had started innocently enough, just dropping off a card and presents from the family, stay for coffee... Nothing special. But it had escalated.\n\nWell, it was about to deescalate rather quickly, sadly enough. Was there time to get dressed? Maybe for Ducky, but Ramses was already wearing the... Duck suit. There wouldn't be time for him to change into more normal clothes, and explaining the stains on the damn thing would be embarrassing to say the least. No. It wouldn't do.\n\n\"...You're gonna have to hide in the closet while I deal with these guys. Hang on.\" Ramses was up now, ready to protest, but it was too late - Ducky was already pulling his trousers up and buttoning his shirt. \n\n\"Keep yourself warmed up, I'll be back up in 20 minutes, max!\" He called before shutting the door, leaving Ramses alone in the room with nothing but blue balls and a wet patch on the bed.\n\n*Part 2 coming soon*"], ["author", "plazmablu"]]
